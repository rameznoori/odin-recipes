    <h3>Lamb Stew - Shorba</h3>
    <p>The aroma of shorba (pronounced shorwa) fills both homes and streets in Afghanistan.
        Shorba is one of the most common comfort foods amongst both Afghan home cooks and street merchants.
        <br>My family and I enjoy this easily and quickly prepared every day meal with a salad and freshly baked bread.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Ibs lamb meat, some pieces with fat in it</li>
        <li>1 large size onion</li>
        <li>2 medium size tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno chili pepper</li>
        <li>4 carrots</li>
        <li>3 potatoes small/medium size</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic paste</li>
        <li>½ tbsp ginger paste</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup chickpeas soaked for 1 hour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnanom</li>
        <li>6 cups hot water </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the vegetables. Peel and wash the potatoes, onion, tomatoes, and carrots</li>
        <li>I like to use smaller whole potatoes in my stew. Cut the onion in small pieces. Using a food processor, chop the onion. Pulse a few times until onion is finely chopped and put aside. Cut the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Then pulse in a food processor until crushed and put aside. Next, peel the carrots, cut them in about two inch pieces and put aside. Lastly, wash the cilantro and finely chop.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and 2 tablespoons of oil in a pot. Fry the meat for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and fry for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic paste, ginger paste, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, cinnamon, salt, pepper, turmeric powder, chickpeas, carrots, cilantro, potatoes, and jalapeño. Mix everything together and stir for 2 minutes. Some people like to skip step 1 and 2 and throw all the ingredients in the pot at once. I prefer to fry the meat and onion first as I think this gives the stew the best flavor</li>
        <li>Add 6 cups of hot water. You can add more or less water depending on how thick you want your stew</li>
        <li>Place the pot in the oven and cook over 350 degrees for 2 hours</li>
        <li>Serve in a bowl. Enjoy!</li>
